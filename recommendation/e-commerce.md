### Problem
We have a e-ecommerce platform where allow people can register their store to sell their products and other people can go there to search buy anything they want. The problem is your platform has launched for a long time, but our revenue is decreasing and customers allway complain that our website is so boring, the platform's products are not fascinating. 
The board directors decide to use Machine learning or AI recommended products, which customers are caring and craving for. The target is increase revenue for the company and provide good experiences for customers as well as gain more new customers.
To delivery these kind of products to customers we have to build a recommeded system.
